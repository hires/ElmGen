Introduction:

makegen is a program for automatically generating Makefiles from a source
tree. It uses gcc to figure out depedencies and produces a proper Makefile
that can contain any number of nested subdirectories. It is inspired by a
shell script that was found online, except it only handled source files in
the current directory. Normally this program is run by a shell script in
the source tree that contains all the required parameters. As files are
added to the project, simply run the shell script again and a new Makefile
will be generated. For an example of how to use it, see the GitHub repository
for CARBON:

Support for sources:

Andrew Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick Audio provides NO SUPPORT for the code and
scripts provided here. If you can't figure it out or get it to work for you,
sorry about that. We make our living by selling hardware, which we support
very well. We believe in open source and want to contribute what we can, but
simply do not have the resouces to answer emails related to this code. All
feature and bug requests, or suggestions should be performed through the
online GitHub source repository. Emails received directly by Kilpatrick Audio 
or Andrew Kilpatrick will unfortunately go unanswered.
